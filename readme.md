## User Manual

Once the project is opened, you will see a form with some questions. You can respond to the form and at the end, click on **Validate**.

As we said in the report those questions are to answer after an electrocardiogramm.

In order to test the accuracy of the model, you can use **donnees_cardiologie_en.xlsx** or **donnees_cardiologie_fr.xlsx** to guide your answers.

These files contain all the responses of the patients and the results (sick/safe).
